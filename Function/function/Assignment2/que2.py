#  Employee Bonus Calculation (Using filter() and map() with Lambda Expressions)


# A software company wants to reward its high-performing employees with a 10% bonus. However, only employees earning ₹50,000 or more are eligible for
#  the bonus.

# As a software developer, your task is to:

# Filter the salaries of eligible employees.
# Calculate the updated salary after adding a 10% bonus.
# Display the final salaries of the eligible employees.

# Note: Use filter() to identify eligible employees and map() to calculate the updated salaries. Both operations must use lambda expressions.

# Input Format
# The first line contains an integer N, representing the number of employees.
# The second line contains N space-separated salary values.
# Output Format

# Display the updated salaries of all eligible employees after adding a 10% bonus.

# Sample Input
# Enter the number of employees:
# 6

# Enter the salaries:
# 35000 50000 62000 45000 70000 55000
# Sample Output
# Eligible Employees' Updated Salaries:
# 55000.0 68200.0 77000.0 60500.0
